<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Durga Prasad Aelay from India, and I moved to Uunites States to do my master's. I have worked as a software
  engineer for three
  years, but I want to gain more practical experience in the IT field, so I've decided to go towards a master's degree
  in the Information technology. My major is Information Technology and currently I completed my second semester. I
  choose this course to gain practical experience with programming languages and software tools for processing network
  data, visualizing threats, and finding malicious activity on networks and I intend to transform cybersecurity problems
  into data science problems that may be resolved using contemporary data science tools, such as modern data
  visualization also to use data science methods on cybersecurity datasets.</p>

<p>I received my undergraduate degree in India. Later, I began working with cognizant as a windows administrator, where
  I was introduced to applications like ServiceNow, osmosys, and other software. I aspire to become a full stack
  developer. As the field of full stack development is constantly evolving, it is essential to be a continuous learner
  and to be adaptable to new technologies. I consider it is essential to collaborate because it helps in creating a
  positive work environment.</p>
